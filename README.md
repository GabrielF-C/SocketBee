# SocketBee

THIS MAY BE DANGEROUS. BE CAREFUL. A MusicBee plugin that allows interacting with the plugin API using sockets. This allows external programs to control MusicBee and hopefully not be exploited by malicious actors that use this to delete your whole PC or open a backdoor or something.

Tested with MusicBee v3.5.8698. Requires .NET Framework 4.0.
